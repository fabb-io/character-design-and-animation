# character-design-and-animation
Drawing portfolio, Team project, and personal project

Here you can see what I managed to learn with my first time approaching this kind of subject.
From basic drawing warks to personal Character Design presentation,
followed up by a project of 3D Model, Character Design creation and Animation.

Here the link to the files(the project are heavy and git is giving me trouble uploading them):
